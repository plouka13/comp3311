# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q12

(a)
T1:           W(Y)     W(X)
T2:  R(Y)                       W(X)
T3:                                      W(X)

X: T1 -> T2
Y: T2 -> T1

since the above precendences cause a loop in a precendence graph
we can deduce that the above graph is not conflict serializable.

(b)
Original schedule S
T1:           W(Y)     W(X)
T2:  R(Y)                       W(X)
T3:                                      W(X)

Since T1 - T3, we have 3! = 6 possible serial schedules.

Since T3 writes X last and there are no other operations, we have to keep T3 W(X) last.

therefore...

T1:                    W(Y)     W(X)
T2:  R(Y)    W(X)
T3:                                      W(X)

is view equivalent to S
and therefore S is view serializable
